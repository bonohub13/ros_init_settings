# ros_init_settings
This is for users using Ubuntu Bionic-Beaver(18.04) and Artful(17.04) and wants to be lazy for ros installation.

## === NOTE ======
If there were any problems or anything, please let me know at: bonohub13 or ken.saito.0813@gmail.com  
(it really helps!)  
  
This is only available for Ubuntu Bionic-Beaver(18.04) and Artful(17.04) since it's using a version of melodic!
