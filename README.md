# ros_init_settings
This is for users using Ubuntu Bionic-Beaver(18.04) and Artful(17.04) and wants to be lazy for ros installation.

## === NOTE ======
If there were any problems or anything, please let me know at: bonohub13 or ken.saito.0813@gmail.com  
(it really helps!)  
  
This is only available for Ubuntu Bionic-Beaver(18.04) and Artful(17.04) since it's using a version of melodic!  
For more info for ROS, go to `http://www.ros.org/`

###### Thank you for using this package!
  
## === UPDATE/FIXED DATES =====
May/19/2019: The Melodic wasn't available for Xenial but instead, for Artful. ~SORRY FOLKS~  
So make sure your ubuntu isn't using Xenial but instead is Artful or Bionic.
